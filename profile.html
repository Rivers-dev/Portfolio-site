			Hi! I'm Connor. I've been doing one form of coding or another for the vast majority of my lifetime, and am always learning new things. 
			I have experience in C, C++, C#, Assembly, Python, JS, HTML, CSS (though HTML and CSS aren't technically true languages), Node.js, React.js, and jQuery.
			I'm completely self taught, having only taken a single computer class in high school, which has been a challenge for sure. However, I think it's 
			valuable experience in problem solving and self-sufficiency. This website is still in development, as I don't have as much experience in the
			markups that go into website creation. Having to design and create the logos was quite a challenge for someone like me! However, I will continue 
			to improve and redesign it for viewing pleasure. Stay tuned!
